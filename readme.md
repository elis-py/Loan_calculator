## Project "Loan calculator"

**Level:** easy.

**Imported libraries:** math, argparse.


**Annotation:** The Loan calculator works from the command line and parses 
the parameters (like a loan principal and interest) according with selected 
type of loan (annuity payment and differentiated payment). Then it calculates 
the values the user wants to know (for example, monthly payment or overpayment), 
and outputs them to the user.
